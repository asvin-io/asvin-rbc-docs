Risk by Context™ provides a glossary to ensure a clear and consistent understanding of key 
cybersecurity and OT-related terms. It helps users interpret contextual parameters, risk assessment 
factors, and security controls accurately. A well-defined glossary enhances communication, reduces 
ambiguity, and supports effective decision-making within the Risk by Context™ system.

    Context
        Context refers to the circumstances, environment, and additional information surrounding 
        an OT device, which help assess its operational state, security posture, and potential risks.

    Contextual Data
        Contextual data refers to information that enhances risk assessment by incorporating 
        relevant environmental and situational factors. In RBC, contextual data includes elements 
        such as network segment size, operational significance, and business continuity plans, 
        helping to understand context of devices in a OT environment to assess and prioritize their 
        cyber security risks.
